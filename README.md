SeaBattle (BattleShip) Game Created with Phaser
Date:
November 2021

Motivation
Using Phaser was a requirement for a module at Hyper Island. My team and I decided on creating the SeaBattle game before we learned how to use Phaser. Interestingly, our game stood out from other students' projects, as it didn't involve running, jumping, or combat mechanics.

Learning Outcomes
Phaser Framework: Understanding how Phaser works and its capabilities.
Creative Problem-Solving: Finding workarounds within the framework, such as creating a grid or avoiding scene creation.
Code Structuring: Learning to destructure and organize code effectively.
Team Management: Taking responsibility for team organization and coordination.
Mathematical Application: Applying mathematical concepts in frontend development.
I started by pseudocoding the game based on a vanilla JS description, but had to adapt and create a modified pseudocode to suit Phaser's functionality.

Usage Instructions
We developed a You-Against-PC version of the game. You have 70 attempts to find 6 pieces of 2-cell ships and 4 pieces of 1-cell ships. Please mute your PC if you are sensitive to sound before playing. Play SeaBattle
